These lectures are a mix of [Qiskit Machine Learning book](), our book and some exercises. 
They consist of a series of Jupyter notebooks. 

1. For running these locally, you'll need: 
   1. [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
   2. `git` (optionally a github account) 
   3. (optional) an IDE (like Dataspell or PyCharm)
   4. (optional) A server with GPUs  
   you can also use services like IBMQ, however they offer very limited resources at free tier.  
2. Create a conda environment that runs python=3.8 and has packages `qiskit-machine-learning`, `jupyter` 
3. go to [course github page](https://github.com/osbama/Phys710) and clone the repository 
4. (you'll need to pull the updates at each lecture)
